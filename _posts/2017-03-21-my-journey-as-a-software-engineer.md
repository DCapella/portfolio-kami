title: My journey as a Software Engineer
---
* Frontend development
* Backend development
* Software engineering principals

These are the stops along my path to being a software engineer.

When starting out, I knew I wanted to do coding. I had no idea really what that involved or how to go about it. I didn’t know the differences between web development and software development. I hadn’t a clue on what language to learn or how I would go about learning. There was a lot I did not know about, but I knew I wanted to do it somehow, someway.

My main first interests in life involved math and languages. It wasn’t hard to see how that would relate to computer science. I started to learn Java on my own, seeing how my friend gave me that book and told me to start there (he was some sort of software developer thats been around). It was complicated but I did my best, even not knowing how that would help me in the end. I always felt like I was grasping on air pretending that I was moving forward.

This was during my time moving furniture around for a company called Rooms to Go. I got promoted to a salesman in said company and budget enough money to go to school. Seeing how I don’t know what I don’t know, I had no goals or any sort of idea on how I would get to being some sort of coding person (as I had no idea how many jobs there were involving computer science). I decided I would like a coding bootcamp more then regular college for the time being because I would only have enough time for one or maybe two classes (since I was working over 40 hours a week) and that would take close to 10 years!

Of course I had to research and test out different ideas and such. Along that way I quickly learned that there is very many different aspects of software development. I decided that software engineering was the way to go for me. Now I had to find an online bootcamp for software engineering that would allow me to work at a slower pace than how most bootcamps work (usually around 12 hour days). After reading testimonies along with my new found knowledge of what I actually wanted and how to go about it, I landed across Bloc. Everything they offered and how they offered is almost exactly what I was looking for.

Now, I just finished up the Frontend part and on my way to learning Backend development. I have a goal of where I want to go (Software engineer with full-stack capabilities in case you weren’t paying attention) and how to get there. The best part is, I absolutely love the journey.
