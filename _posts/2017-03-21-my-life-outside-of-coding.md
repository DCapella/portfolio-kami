title: My life outside of coding
---
When I’m not learning how to code, I have many other interests as well as a job that has yet to do with actual coding (unfortunately, but soon enough). My current job as a salesman for furniture takes up most of my time through out the week. Not to mention I like to be good at my job, whatever it is, so I will always read up and do studying how to do my job better. Now when I’m not working, I’m either working out, eating, or doing something different.

I didn’t start off as a salesman, however.  I started off with the title of porter, which involved:

* Unloading furniture
* Putting furniture together
* Moving furniture
* Fixing furniture
* As well as helping the designer put up huge paintings/pictures and accessories

It’s a pretty easy job, just some what physically demanding but it was really nothing because when I started, I had just just got out of the military. I knew I wanted to be in sales though because it would be a good skill to learn as well as help pay for my schooling. So I worked a lot harder and longer then my other porters. I made it known what I was going for and wouldn’t accept anything but a promotion. Eventually I got it. I was mostly excited because I could start figuring out what I wanted to do for my education.

Besides my job, I spend a lot of time studying health and fitness (and of course; actually exercising). It started as an interest and grew into something more as I put more time and effort into it. I even got certified as a personal trainer from NASM, but that’s not what I wanted for my career. Just needed another possible opportunity to pay for my education (I bet you can see my common goal here, huh?). I like to think I can make some tasty food. As well as bake pretty well too. It all goes hand in hand with health and fitness.

Other interests I have vary. Anything from attending church, to reading, to walking, to spending time with friends, anything to switch things up and enjoy life. Its always important to keep balance in life. 

Well, in the end, coding started off as just a mere idea and turned quickly into one of my biggest passions. I can learn about it, and do it, and enjoy every second of it. But, I do have interests outside of coding. I merely like to enjoy life and what it has to offer. I work hard, and enjoy it. I would much rather like more things and ideas then not. Who knows how much time I will have, so I would like to go to sleep every night knowing I did what I could and ready for the next day. That doesn’t mean doing anything crazy, it simply means making the best and appreciating what you have.
