title: My experience with Bloc
---
I am currently 12 weeks in and just finished the Frontend module.

The Bloc Software Developer Track so far has done not only what I had expected but much more. It encourages you to do research on your own as well as side learning which helps you in the long run to solve ideas on your own. Not to mention it allows learning within Bloc much more easy because you're used to researching what you don't know. I now know so many different ways to learn aspects of coding and how the different languages are so different yet so similar. It really is a way of thinking.

It has its own methods of teaching as well as outside teaching. It has a great way to start with fundamentals, going to hands-on, and to you doing it mostly on your own.

Each checkpoint and assignment you do; allows you to get a review of it. I feel this is very important showing that they are always trying to find ways to improve and will take all aspects into consideration.

Bloc seems to be able to keep it entertaining because I have yet to get bored, I feel confident in what I am learning so it keeps me hungry to do more. And now I am fully enjoying each and every assignment no matter how hard.

In addition to the curriculum, you get a mentor. Now, you may not always need the mentor for the coding but your mentor will be an invaluable tool through out your learning journey. My mentor has told me much more about how life will be during your job as well as hiring and even looking for a job. Keeps me confident in what I'm doing and motivated to learn more. As your doing the checkpoints and assignments, if you happen to get stuck, the mentors will always do their best to reply to you in a timely fashion to get you un-stuck. It usually doesn't take long and you can use that time to either keep on trying different ideas and researching or using that time to learn up from other websites.

In conclusion, in my search for a coding bootcamp (as well as trying some such as coursera), I decided upon Bloc and have not been disappointed. I have done other certificate courses such as for personal training through NASM but have never been so sure of myself as I am now doing Bloc. Great opportunity. I still have many more months left but I already feel that I have learned so much and am so eager to learn more. And more. And more. I already feel prepared to tackle any problem that I will be finding along my way (and Iâ€™m barely 1/3rd done!). This is very exciting for me and very happy I did my research correctly to land upon Bloc.
