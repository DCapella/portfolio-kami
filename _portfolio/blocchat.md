## Explanation

BlocChat is a simple application that can be used to ‘chat’ with other users within rooms you create or are already created and with a username that you choose.

## Problem

Users need to be able to see chat rooms available as well as the messages within those selected chat rooms. They need to be able to send messages with a username that they pick that will show up for the messages. Finally, they need to be able to create their own chat room.

## Solution

Using Firebase to build BlocChat allows us to send and receive messages, as well as create and use different chat rooms and usernames. Putting Firebase as a module in an Angular application and injecting the $firebaseArray service into a controller. Using Firebase JavaScript and AngularFire APIs. Also, making use of modals from UI Bootstrap. Finally, storing information in cookies.

## Results

Fun project that now allows users to simply chat with each other as expected.

## Conclusion

Could definitely use some touch ups, added benefits and security but does what it’s supposed to do while teaching me, as a learner, a lot more about how different codes, and such, work.
